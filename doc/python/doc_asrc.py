# OVERVIEW
#
# This script generates a set of test files for the supported input and output rates.
# It passes these through the golden reference "C" models, and
# Plots the FFTs, and extracts the SNR and THD.
# All this info is annotated on the Plot which is saved to the output folder.
#
# Note that both the C model is a dual-channel implementations, so we pass them a pair of source files
# and since this is ASRC, we vary the frequency deviation parameter fDev.
# But, OS3 and DS3 are single channel apps - which is dealt with!

The FFT plots in this section provide a visual guide to the performance of the SSRC, ASRC, DS3 and OS3 sample rate converters.
Test signals were created allowing analysis of the sample rate converter output across different scenarios.

Two input signals were played through a stereo sample rate converter across a range of input and output sample rates.
For Channel 0, a single pure tone was generated ensuring its frequency was well within the overall nyquist rate.
For Channel 1, multiple tones spaced logarithmically were generated with the spacing most dense at higher frequencies.

The resulting frequency plot output clearly shows the noise floor relative to the sample rate converted injected tone(s).
The plots are annotated with an estimate of the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) as well as Total Harmonic Distortion (THD).

For the case of the ASRC, in addition to the nominal input frequency of 0 PPM deviation, the +/-100 PPM frequency deviation cases are also shown.
